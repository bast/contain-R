# contain-R

Apptainer/Singularity container for reproducible R environments.


## What you need for this to work

- [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) or [Singularity CE](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/introduction.html)
- `install.R` or `renv.lock` file (examples below) that define the environment
- An R script/project/command that you want to run in that environment
- You **do not need to install R itself** (R 4.3.0 is provided by the container)


## Motivation and big picture

For reproducibility it is important to:
- document dependencies
- isolate dependencies from dependencies of other projects

This container creates a per-project
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)-environment and isolates dependencies.

To speed up package installation it uses [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/) under
the hood.  At the same time, it allows to configure a user- or group-wide cache
which can be reused across projects.


## Quick start

...


## `install.R` or `renv.lock` or both?

You need something to define the environment you want, either `install.R` or `renv.lock`.

An `install.R` file looks like this:
```r
renv::install('ggplot2')
renv::install('vcfR')
renv::install('hierfstat')
renv::install('poppr')
```

List as many packages as you need. You can pin them to specific versions, if
needed:
```r
renv::install("digest@0.6.18")
```

Alternatively, you can create your environment from `renv.lock` which looks
like this example:
```json
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "3.6.1",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cloud.r-project.org"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "markdown": {
      "Package": "markdown",
      "Version": "1.0",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "4584a57f565dd7987d59dda3a02cfb41"
    },
    "mime": {
      "Package": "mime",
      "Version": "0.7",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "908d95ccbfd1dd274073ef07a7c93934"
    }
  }
}
```
For more information, please see
<https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/lockfiles.html>.

The container will process them in this order:
- If there is only `install.R`, it will use that one and create an `renv` environment and lock dependencies in `renv.lock`.
- If there is only `renv.lock`, it will use that one and create an `renv` environment.
- If `install.R` is more recent than `renv`, it will install from it (again).
- If `renv.lock` is more recent than `renv`, it will install from it (again).

In practice you will probably do either of these two:
- You arrive with `install.R` and it will create `renv.lock` and `renv`. You
  can then take the `renv.lock` and use it to share an environment with your
  friend.
- Or you arrive with `renv.lock` that you got from somebody and it will create
  `renv`.


## Generated paths

Running the container creates the following files and directories:
- `renv` - holding the environment
- `renv.lock` - created or updated if you installed from `install.R`
- creates or modifies `.Rprofile` - [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) adds the line `source("renv/activate.R")`
- `renv-cache` - [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package cache; you can change its location by defining environment variable `RENV_CACHE`
- `pak-cache` - [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/) package cache; you can change its location by defining environment variable `RENV_CACHE`

## Pak and renv use different caches and methods

...


## Known problems/ ideas for later

- Maybe you need a different version of R than 4.3.0. I guess we should at some
  point have several containers for different versions?
- It could be useful to let the user configure where `renv` itself should be
  located. Currently it is placed in the same folder where the container is run.
